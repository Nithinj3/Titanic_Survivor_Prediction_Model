# Titanic_Survivor_Prediction_Model
Titanic Survivor Prediction Model Using Decision Tree and Ensemble Methods( Random Forest).

I have used Titanic passengers dataset for prediction modeling.I used NumPy and Pandas, for manipulating the datasets.The goal was to explore the tools related to data science and to explore the various libraries used for data analysis.
I have used the Random forests classifier ensemble method using decision trees to predict the survivor in the given dataset.
